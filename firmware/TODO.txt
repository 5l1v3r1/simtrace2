== Important DFU topics / reliability ==
x some kind of DFU fallback / boot cycle counter ?
* CRC check of image before attempting to execute it ?
x Keep WDT running while in DFU or app
? USB control request for flash erase

== QModem related ==
x new vendor/product ID for hub and SAM3s
* board-specfic string descriptors
* re-mapping of USB ports in EEPROM

== Lower Priority ==
* unique serial number in iSerial?
* printing of banner from generic function
* board_main_top() automatically before calling main()
x compile-time USB string generation
* shared USB strings for DFU and runtime
* version detection voltage ranges
* locking of bootloader pages?
* debug console command for switch-to-dfu
* read CPU reset cause (and time?) via USB
